# Go-live runbook — sandbox → live

**Deploy model:** the `photography` prod Worker is **git-connected via Cloudflare
Workers Builds**. A push/merge to the production branch (`main`) triggers CI
(`opennextjs-cloudflare deploy`, top-level `photography` env) and **the site goes
live**. There is no separate manual prod deploy step. Therefore:

> **The merge to `main` IS the cutover.** Every live secret, build var, and the
> `PRODIGI_MODE=live` flag must already be staged BEFORE the merge. The merge is
> the one irreversible action; treat it as the go/no-go.

The `photography-preview` Worker (deployed manually via `wrangler deploy --env
preview`) stays on sandbox and is untouched by this — it remains the rollback/QA
surface.

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS (2026-07-01): BLOCKED on Stripe Issuing

Everything below except the no-float funding pipeline is done and verified
(§0, §1, §2, §4 all complete — see checkmarks). **Physical-order go-live is
blocked** on:

1. **Stripe Issuing approval** — the no-float funding pipeline (§4 of
   `docs/fap-print-fulfilment.md`) needs a EUR virtual card on this account to
   pay Prodigi. Self-serve "Get Started" in the dashboard silently fails.
   **Confirmed via Stripe support chat (ground truth):** the instant-Issuing
   flow is for Connect platforms issuing to *other* connected accounts. A
   single card on our own account for paying a supplier requires a **formal
   Stripe Sales application** (`stripe.com/issuing`), not a dashboard click —
   unknown approval timeline.
   - Correction: an earlier pass this session wrongly concluded Denmark isn't
     in Stripe's local-Issuing country list and that this was the blocker —
     that was a bad inference from a doc skim, not the real cause. Don't
     repeat that claim.
2. **The balance-transfer worker itself is unbuilt** — even once Issuing is
   approved, the actual polling/transfer/order-submission pipeline (design in
   `docs/fap-print-fulfilment.md` §4) needs to be written and sandbox-tested
   before it can run for real.

**Do not merge `final` → `main` until both are resolved.** Digital-only launch
(no physical products) was considered and explicitly declined in favor of
waiting — see [[stripe-live-calls-test-only]].

## 0. Authorisation gate (blocks everything)

- [x] **Lifted 2026-07-01** — owner explicitly confirmed lifting
      `stripe-live-calls-test-only` and Prodigi sandbox-only. Merge-to-main and
      the first live order each still need their own fresh confirmation at that
      moment (not blanket-covered by this).
- [x] **Verified fresh 2026-07-01** — real sandbox checkout on
      `photography-preview.gusmcewan.workers.dev` (fine-art framed 24×36 +
      Express shipping, Stripe test card, order `GMP-LOKI-E5ZAE`). Confirmed via
      Prodigi sandbox API (`ord_1161794`, correct SKU/asset/callback URL) AND the
      origin's admin-orders record (`fulfilment.prodigiId` populated, `mode:
      "sandbox"`, VAT evidence captured). Order was still `stage: "InProgress"`
      at check time — the async Prodigi status **callback** hadn't landed yet,
      so only order-creation is proven fresh; the callback-updates-record path
      is proven by code read + the 2026-06-17 build note, not by this test.

## 1. Green production build (do FIRST — before any live config)

- [x] **Fixed 2026-07-01** (`c9c80a4`): every recent `photography` prod build was
      failing on `npm ci` — `package-lock.json` had drifted from `package.json`
      (missing `@swc/helpers@0.5.23` etc). Regenerated **under the exact CI
      toolchain** (node 22.16.0 / npm 10.9.2, via `nvm use 22.16.0` —
      regenerating under local npm 11 produces a much larger, spurious diff).
      Verified `npm ci` and `next build` both pass clean under that toolchain.
- [ ] Confirm the CF build command and production branch in the Workers Builds
      settings (dashboard → Worker `photography` → Settings → Builds).

## 2. Stripe (live) — external, you do these

- [x] KYB complete; account activated for live payments (confirmed 2026-07-01,
      also per [[launch-status-and-next-phase]] 2026-06-15).
- [ ] (If no-float Issuing model) Issuing approved, card created, funding arranged
      (`docs/fap-print-fulfilment.md`).
- [x] Live webhook endpoint exists (`https://gusmcewan.com/api/webhook/stripe`)
      with the 3 correct events (checkout.session.completed,
      checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded, charge.refunded — confirmed
      2026-07-01). Signing secret in hand, ready for §4 dashboard entry.
- [x] Live coupons — **N/A for launch**: no coupons currently exist; test
      coupons deleted 2026-07-01; coupons will be added post-launch.
- [x] Live `sk_live_…`, `pk_live_…`, `whsec_…` — all set on the Worker (§4).

## 3. Prodigi (live) — external

- [ ] Live Prodigi account funded/enabled; live API key in hand
      (`.env.local` → `PRODIGI_LIVE_API_KEY`).
- [ ] EU / NL-only routing arrangement confirmed, so `checkEuFulfilment` doesn't
      reject real orders. **Under live the EU guard genuinely runs** (sandbox omits
      `shipments`; the two sandbox bypasses in `shipping-quotes` and
      `checkout-session` self-disable because they're gated on
      `prodigiMode() === 'sandbox'`).
- [ ] One real low-cost live order placed to confirm assets, cropping, shipping.

## 4. Cloudflare dashboard config for the `photography` Worker (pre-stage)

**IMPORTANT — corrected 2026-07-01:** `npm run deploy` runs
`opennextjs-cloudflare deploy` with **no `--env` flag**, so CI deploys the
**top-level (unnamed) config block** in `wrangler.jsonc` — NOT a nested
`env.production` block (there isn't one, and adding one would be silently
ignored by CI). Verified via `wrangler deploy --dry-run`: with no `--env`, the
top-level `vars` resolve, including `PRODIGI_MODE`.

Set **once, in the dashboard**, on the production Worker — these persist across
merges and are NOT in git.

**Build-time environment variables** (Settings → Build → production_settings
environment_variables — needed at `next build`, because `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is
inlined into the client bundle):

- [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_live_…` — set 2026-07-01,
      `is_secret: false` (correct — it's meant to be public), verified via
      `GET /accounts/{id}/builds/workers/{script_tag}`.

**Runtime secrets** (Settings → Variables and Secrets → encrypted) — all 7
confirmed bound 2026-07-01 via `GET
/accounts/{id}/workers/scripts/photography/settings`:

- [x] `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- [x] `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (the live endpoint's — endpoint + 3 events already
      existed from earlier work)
- [x] `PRODIGI_API_KEY` (live)
- [x] `SHOP_ORIGIN_SECRET` (same value as preview — one physical tunnel/origin
      serves both)
- [x] `DOWNLOAD_LINK_SECRET` — freshly generated random value (preview's
      `.env.local` entry was a `dev-local-…` placeholder, not a real value to
      reuse, so rotated instead)
- [x] `ADMIN_PASSWORD` — owner's existing password, entered directly (never
      touched by Claude — exists only in owner's memory, not in any file)
- [x] `CRON_SECRET` — already present pre-existing on this Worker

**Runtime vars** — ✅ already committed in `wrangler.jsonc` top-level (`8fe27ea`,
on branch `final`), no dashboard action needed:

- [x] `SHOP_ORIGIN_URL = https://valhalla.gusmcewan.com`
- [x] `SHOP_PREVIEW_BASE_URL = https://loki.gusmcewan.com` (despite the name,
      this is just a public image-CDN host toggle — see `src/lib/shop.ts:206-217`
      — not Worker-environment-specific, so prod reuses preview's value)
- [x] `PRODIGI_MODE = live`   ← the flip. Code defaults to `sandbox` when unset
      (`src/lib/prodigi.ts:23`); mode is explicit, never key-sniffed.

**Bindings / domain:**

- [ ] `SHOP_SETTINGS` KV bound on the prod Worker — currently **shares** preview's
      namespace id `8a07bbf…` (same in both top-level and `env.preview` config).
      Decide if pricing/settings should be a dedicated prod namespace instead
      (left shared for now — not blocking).
- [x] Custom domain — **already attached**, discovered 2026-07-01 via
      `GET /accounts/{id}/workers/domains`: `gusmcewan.com`, `www.gusmcewan.com`,
      `gusmcewan.uk`, `www.gusmcewan.uk` all routed to `photography`, enabled.
      No action needed.

## 5. Go-live PR (the merge that flips it) — committed changes

The actual go-live PR is **`final` → `main`** — branch `final` is **277 commits**
ahead of `origin/main` (the entire shop build: cart, VAT, Prodigi fulfilment,
fine-art, admin, this go-live prep). `origin/main` hasn't moved since the last
SEO-only PR.

- [x] Top-level `vars` block with **`PRODIGI_MODE: "live"`** committed in
      `wrangler.jsonc` (`8fe27ea`). Verified with `wrangler deploy --dry-run`
      that it resolves with no `--env` flag — i.e. exactly what CI will deploy.
- [x] Version bump: `1.34.52` → `1.35.0` (`8fe27ea`).
- [ ] Decide: merge `final` → `main` as one 277-commit PR, or land it in smaller
      reviewed chunks first? Given the size, at minimum diff-review the
      accumulated changes before opening the PR.

## 6. Pre-cutover verification

Because merge = live, you can't "deploy then test" on prod cheaply. Options:

- [ ] Verify the **full 8-scenario matrix** (digital / poster / fine-art / mixed) on
      a **staging Worker built from the go-live branch with live keys** (e.g. a
      versioned preview deploy of `photography`, or a temporary named Worker), OR
- [ ] Accept a **live smoke test immediately post-merge**: one real card purchase per
      product type, refunded, watching:
  - Stripe live webhook signature validates with the live `whsec_`.
  - Order → Prodigi **live** order created (idempotent on orderCode).
  - Prodigi webhook received + verified-by-refetch.
  - Download links issued and valid.
  - VAT correct by country (manual VAT: DK rate DK+EU by IP, 0% non-EU, Stripe Tax
    OFF, one Stripe amount, no `tax_rate` objects).
  - Shipping quotes resolve; EU guard passes a real NL-routed order.

## 7. Cutover — DONE 2026-07-02

- [x] Merged `final` → `main` (fast-forward, `b476933`), pushed, triggered the
      Workers Build.
- [x] **First build failed**: `Cannot find module '@ast-grep/napi-linux-x64-gnu'`
      — the earlier lockfile fix (`c9c80a4`) was only ever verified on this
      Mac (macOS), never on Linux x64 (Cloudflare's actual build platform).
      Fixed properly with a full fresh `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
      && npm install` (not just `--package-lock-only`), which correctly
      captured all 9 `@ast-grep/napi-*` platform variants. Verified this time
      by actually running `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` locally end to
      end, not just `next build`. Commit `d54167b`.
- [x] Two subsequent builds got stuck at "Initializing build environment..."
      indefinitely (0 progress into Cloning) — unrelated to the lockfile fix.
      Owner cancelled, created a fresh build token, retried — third attempt
      built and deployed successfully (build `7fff2c90`).
- [x] Verified live: `gusmcewan.com/shop` → 200, `POST /api/checkout-session`
      → real app response (not 404), `PRODIGI_MODE: "live"` bound (confirmed
      via Cloudflare API), all 4 custom domains still attached (a wrangler
      deploy warning about differing remote routes/IMAGES binding turned out
      to only drop the unused `IMAGES` binding — nothing else affected).
- [x] `workers/prodigi-cron` redeployed with its `MAIN` binding pointed at
      `photography` (prod) instead of `photography-preview` — this was fixed
      in code earlier but needed its own separate `wrangler deploy` (it's not
      part of the main app's git-triggered Workers Build). Confirmed via the
      owner's own deploy output: `env.MAIN (photography)`, both schedules
      active.
- [ ] Enable the Stripe live webhook; leave test webhook as-is. (Webhook
      already exists with all 6 needed events — confirm it's the active one
      in Stripe's dashboard, not left disabled.)

## 8. Rollback

- [ ] Fastest: in the dashboard, **roll the `photography` Worker back to the previous
      deployment** (Workers Builds keeps prior versions), or revert the PR and let CI
      redeploy.
- [ ] `photography-preview` (sandbox) is untouched — keep it as the working QA
      surface.
- [ ] Have Stripe refund + Prodigi cancel-window ready for the first live orders.

### Config surface reference (what the app reads)

`process.env`: `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `CRON_SECRET`, `DOWNLOAD_LINK_SECRET`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `PRODIGI_API_KEY`, `PRODIGI_MODE`,
`SHOP_ORIGIN_SECRET`, `SHOP_ORIGIN_URL`, `SHOP_PREVIEW_BASE_URL`,
`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Stripe live/test is **inferred from the `sk_…` prefix** (`src/lib/coupons.ts:38`);
Prodigi is **explicit** via `PRODIGI_MODE` (`src/lib/prodigi.ts:23`). The
`delete-test-coupons` admin route refuses to run under `sk_live`
(`src/app/api/admin/delete-test-coupons/route.ts:22`).
